<h1> ScrumManager üìÉüìå</h1> 
<hr>
<p>Web application designed for NaturalSolutions. Used to manage the Scrum of the company.</p>
<h5><i>Reminder how the scrum methodology work:</i> Time is divided into short work cadences, known as sprints, typically one week or two weeks long. The product is kept in a potentially shippable (properly integrated and tested) state at all times. At the end of each sprint, stakeholders and team members meet to see a demonstrated potentially shippable product increment and plan its next steps know as retrospective.</h5>
<h5>Scrum is a simple set of roles, responsibilities, and meetings that never change. By removing unnecessary unpredictability, we‚Äôre better able to cope with the necessary unpredictability of continuous discovery and learning.</h5>
